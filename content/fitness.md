# Fitness

I have been working out for almost a decade now, and it has had a tremendous effect on my mind and body.

So, here's some advice on how to get fit. And a backstory to go along with that.

## They don't call it sweet 16 for nothing. 

It was time for the annual medical check-up that we needed for school. After the doctor told me to step on a scale, she jotted down the numbers 7 and 0, and said to me that I now was classed "overweight" in medical terms.

I was 172cm at 70kg and honestly shocked. To be a fat kid was something I feared, and that fear sparked and urgency in me to start doing something about it.

## In a 7 year span

With no idea on how to get to where I want to be, I started running. My workout routine was only cardio - 4km a day, 5 times a week.

After about 4 years of that, the results were subpar. Lost some fat, but had no muscle. If you looked at me, you couldn't tell that I work out. So I quit cardio and decided to start doing calisthetics. My first PR for pull ups was 4.

I would say that this was the starting point of actual progress. Constant PRs, body morphing into solid, shape. I was gaining mass. And then I went to the military.

Due to the 9 months in the military, I had gained even more muscle. After that, it was back to doing what I know best, pull-ups.

The Covid-19 pandemic was good due to being able to work out at home! My PR's on max pull ups were rising weekly. 

To fully get good body proportions, I started doing ab and legs workouts and have been doing the same thing for 2 years.

The best part is that I'm now keeping it up between 65-70kg, except this time it is mostly muscle. My current PR for pull ups is 55 WITHOUT KIPS (65 with kipping).

## I want to get fit too! Where do I start?

All you need is a yoga mat and a pull-up bar and you're good to go.

Schedule:

* Monday: Upper body.
* Tuesday: Upper body.
* Wednesday: Abs + Legs.
* Thursday: Upper body.
* Friday: Abs.

## The workout

### Upper body

In such order: `Pull ups -> Triceps dips -> Push ups -> Chin ups`

Do each exercise 5 times, each time as many reps as possible and rest for 1 minute between each attempt. After the fifth time, rest for 2 minutes before moving onto the next exercise.

So, in detail, do pull ups once for a max number of reps, then chill for a minute, do pull ups again, chill for a minute... do pull ups for the fifth time, chill for two minutes and move onto the next excercise.

### Abs

10 different abs exercises. For each exercise, you have to either do 50 reps (ex: 50 reps of russian twists) or do a hold for a minute (ex: hold a plank for one minute). Rest when needed.

For inspiration on what exercises you can do, look up [Fraser Wilson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyiNCEHLyKbSUrrncVr9KvQ). If you choose to do harder exercises (ex. leg lifts), you will have faster and better results.

### Legs

In such order: `Lunges -> Leg raises -> Quadruped single leg lift -> Standing calf raises -> Wall-sit -> Squats -> Plank`

For each exercise, you have to either do 50 reps (ex: 50 reps of lunges) or do a hold for a minute (ex: hold a wall-sit for one minute). Between each exercise, do 70 reps of jump rope skips. Rest when needed.
