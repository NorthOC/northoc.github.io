# The 3 modern dragons

*It's been half a year since I wrote my last post. Here's the update for the second half of 2024:*

*Finished studies and got my degree in IT and it went as expected. Travelled from Bulgaria to Japan in the span of 3 months, visiting Turkey, UAE, India and Thailand along the way. You can watch that trip on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@denislisunov/videos). Lost some muscle while travelling, but have managed to build it all back, and then some. And still working on my goal towards 5 000 000. Yes, the project in the previous posts is still being built. Problem is that I have burned out, and the progress is slow. I boot up my PC, but the last thing I want is to open up a code editor, and smash out some code. But I know that this phase will end (because this has happened before) and I will achieve what I have set out to achieve. Things take time. You take time. And everything falls into place, if you keep your goal in mind. Anyways, back to today's post.*

## Intro

This is no fairy tale. 

There are no elves or orcs. 

But there are three dragons. 

With big teeth and horns.

These dragons are mortal - in that they can die. 

But this is no easy task, and there are no guarantees. 

The good news is that you have unlimited tries. 

The bad news is that you have limited time. 

Each dragon requires a different approach. 

And each strategy takes 5 years or more. 

Whether the rewards are worth it, 

Depend only on you. 

But beating them all, 

Will give you something, which no other can do.

## The green dragon (Reward: Health)

If you choose to ignore, avoid or give in.

The dragon will steal your health from within.

So sleep every night.

At the same hour.

Eat greens and meat.

No sugar or flour.

Its weakness is your axe - the workout you do.

Its place of peril is the gym you go to.

Attacking this dragon, 4-5 days a week.

Will give more strength and time that you seek.

## The blue dragon (Reward: Happiness)

This dragon is a trickster. His way is to lie.

If you come alone, then you'll certainly die.

So visit a tavern or volunteer at events.

Shoot many arrows - with strangers and friends.

Be present with people, and don't be afraid.

By sharing your likes and your nays, 

You will find someone.

Who believes and who trusts. 

A sister, a brother, a friend.

Or a partner.

Who will want to join.

And bring your life joy.

## The red dragon (Reward: Freedom)

The red dragon has 4 different games.

And you get to choose, the one's you'll play.

So pick one,

Career, business, rentals or stocks.

Master it well, to grow your loot and your flock.

Avoid status games, for they are a trap.

And also grifters, who sell quick ways out.

Be patient, persistent, 

Because bad times will come.

And after they pass, 

You'll go further and far.

The dragon will die, 

And you will stand tall.

## Ending

By slaying the dragons, you'll get what you want.

You will have the freedom, the time and the love.

But that is not all that is gained from this quest.

The experience, the perspective, 

A new piece of mind.

Will guide your decisions for the rest of your life.
