# Road to 5 million: Intro (part 1)

![Ever sold something you made? The feeling never leaves you.](/static/images/biz-series/problemsolution.jpg)

## Context

The only goal I have not achieved in my life is financial freedom. So I guess, the best time to start is now. 

I always prefered living on fringe frugality, and I would be glad to quit my job and continue doing so. But now, I have a long-term partner and, as I approach 26 years old, it is time to start thinking about family. 

Do I want my family to live frugally? Hell no. I want them to travel, get a good education and grow up in a warm climate, full of fruit trees. While I spend most of my time with them (not working).

Lets begin.

## The goal

Here's a promise: In less than 9 years, I will be retired, chillin with my gf and kids on a farm, travelling at least 1/3rd of the year. This is my reality.

I am going to build a solution to a problem that ultimately creates 5 million euros of value before I reach the age of 35. 

Why 5 million? Because at a very conservative annual return rate of 4%, the index fund would yield me 200k/yr (before taxes). That is more than enough, not only to survive, but to continue building future wealth for the generations to come, after I grow old and die.

## How am I gonna do it

In a vast sea of books, I don't think my chances of becoming the next [J.K. Rowling](https://mangetlaid.com) are great. 

But, because I put my time to good use, I am going to build a business with code.

My plan:

1. Find a problem.
2. Create a solution.
3. Market the solution. 
4. Get feedback. 
5. Improve solution.
6. Go back to step 3.

We are making proper solutions to existing problems with long-term goals in mind. There is no audience to sell to, no brand, no investors or VCs, and none of that "indie hacker SaaS launch in 3 weeks" shit.

## What if you fail?

Here's the good thing: ***I have unlimited tries. And I only need to succeed once.*** Read that again. If I make 10 businesses, fail 9 times and succeed once - that's it. I win. Is that true failure? No. Those previous times would be considered as learning experience.

True failure is giving up.

## What's next?

The first step: finding a problem. Stay tuned.
