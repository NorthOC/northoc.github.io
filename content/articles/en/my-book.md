## Your guide to love and intimacy

This book is a logical approach to love, relationships and intimacy, designed to alleviate the tragedy of loneliness for many boys and men these days.

The book is divided into three parts: theory, tactics and practice.

### Theory

The theory part explains the concept of love and the intimacy market through the prism of evolutionary psychology. From what women want to the criteria by which they choose partners, you'll learn the rules of the game, how to avoid certain pitfalls, and why "good men" (mind the quotes) don't get laid. After completing this part, you will logically be able to analyze yourself, learn from your past mistakes and experiences, and draw conclusions in your favor.

### Tactics

The tactics part is about you and how you can increase your chances of winning the game before playing. How to reduce the influence of genetic defects, how to exercise and eat to get a good-looking body and build self-confidence. After completing this part, you will have a long-term plan for self-development.

### Practice

The practice part is all about how to play the game. How to approach, how to seduce, how to talk, what to text, where to take on a date, how to hold hands, how to kiss, how to interpret signs, how to take home, how to make love, what to do at home, when "no" means no, and criteria for choosing a partner for a happy, long-term relationship. After completing this part, you will know how to go from "hello" to "I love you".
