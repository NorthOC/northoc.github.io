## CLI Apps

* [damp2ph](https://github.com/NorthOC/damp2ph) (Python) - It is a static site generator, markdown parser and HTML beautifier (all in one) which I made with built-in Python libraries. 100% of this website is generated using damp2ph.

* [basedflix](https://github.com/NorthOC/basedflix) (Nodejs) - It is a piracy app for streaming movies in one of the many supported video players. For this to work, I had to reverse-engineer thepiratebay's API. Oh, and I also made a GUI version.

## Data Structure and algorithm implementation

## Embedded programming

* [RFID Queue Management System with AWS](https://github.com/NorthOC/esp32-iot-trash-management-sys) (Embedded C, AWS) - This program was made for the ESP-32 WROOM microcontroller. It basically tracks whose turn it is to take out the trash using RFID and sends an email. Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m09P8awB5_k) of how it works.

## Curriculum vitae
