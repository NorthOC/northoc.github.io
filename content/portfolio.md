## Learning Projects

Here are some of the projects I have made along the way. Some of them are cool, some are yikes. But all of them were part of my journey of becoming a developer.

### Front-End Web Apps (Click to play)

[The Love Game landing page](/book) - Landing page for selling my book.

[Google copycat](https://northoc.github.io/google-homepage/) - It is a visual responsive recreation of Google's homepage.

[Tic Tac Toe](https://northoc.github.io/tic-tac-toe-js/) - I bet you have played this one before.

[Calculator](https://northoc.github.io/calculator/) - One of those projects that every programmer has made. Feel free to try it out (it has keyboard support).

[Book tracker](https://northoc.github.io/book-library-js/) - It is a front-end library web app.

[Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://northoc.github.io/rockpaperscissors/) - The title says it all.

[DnD character creation form](https://northoc.github.io/dnd_charform/) - It is a simple registration form for creating a Dungeons and Dragons character.

[Tensorflow documentation mockup](https://northoc.github.io/doc_mockup/) - A documentation mockup website for Tensorflow.

### Full-stack Web Apps

[Book Dashboard app with JWT-auth](https://github.com/NorthOC/book-dashboard) (Django REST framework) - Users can create their own libraries of books they like, wish to read, and leave a rating. The point of this project was to learn JWT token auth.

[Order delivery management web app](https://github.com/NorthOC/order-pizza) (PHP) - Basically, any restaurant could use this system for deliveries. Customers can create orders. The kitchen staff can then see those orders, and after the order is made, the driver can pick up that order.

[Weather Dashboard app with OpenWeather API](https://github.com/NorthOC/flask-internship-course) (Flask) - Users can create their weather dashboards, show it to their friends and view annual, daily or current weather data (and download it as well).

[Omniva terminal locator app with Omniva API](https://github.com/NorthOC/rails-task) (Ruby on Rails) - Search Omniva parcel terminals by id, location or name and download the list as an Excel file.

[Blog app](https://github.com/NorthOC/rails-blog-app) (Ruby on Rails) - It is a simple CRUD blog app.

[Decathlon leaderboards app](https://github.com/NorthOC/decathlon_leaderboards) (Flask) - It takes a csv file as input and generates the scores and leaderboards for decathlon candidates.

### API microservices

[micro-views](https://github.com/NorthOC/micro-views) (FastAPI + Supabase) - an API microservice for tracking unique website users and total views.

### CLI Apps

[damp2ph](https://github.com/NorthOC/damp2ph) (Python) - It is a static site generator, markdown parser and HTML beautifier (all in one) which I made with built-in Python libraries. 100% of this website is generated using damp2ph.

[fast-scanner](https://github.com/NorthOC/fast_scanner) (Python) - Skyscanner has removed the cheapest month options, so I reverse-engineered their API to get this feature back and add some extra functionality.

[basedflix](https://github.com/NorthOC/basedflix) (Nodejs, Python) - It is a piracy app for streaming movies in one of the many supported video players. For this to work, I had to reverse-engineer thepiratebay's API. Oh, and I also made a GUI version.

[Mastermind](https://replit.com/@NorthOC/Mastermind-game) (Ruby) - It is a code-breaking game. Solve the puzzle yourself or let the AI do it.

[Hangman](https://replit.com/@NorthOC/Hangman) (Ruby) - Yep, you know it. I added the extra feature of being able to save the game and return to it later.

[Connect Four](https://replit.com/@NorthOC/connect-four) (Ruby) - The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) can explain it quicker than me.

[Chess Knight movement](https://github.com/NorthOC/knights-travails) (Ruby) - Calculates the amount of turns it takes for a Knight chess piece to reach a certain square using recursive breadth-first search.

[Email generator with Google Civic API](https://github.com/NorthOC/event_manager_ruby) (Ruby) - It fills out email templates with data from Google Civic API.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

[Linked list](https://github.com/NorthOC/Linked-lists) (Ruby) - Ruby doesn't have a linked list data structure, so I implemented it.

[Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/NorthOC/binary-search-tree) (Ruby) - Recreation of the binary search tree data structure.

[Merge sort](https://github.com/NorthOC/merge-sort) (Ruby) - The implementation of merge sort.

### Embedded programming

[RFID Queue Management System with AWS](https://github.com/NorthOC/esp32-iot-trash-management-sys) (Embedded C, AWS) - This program was made for the ESP-32 WROOM microcontroller. It basically tracks whose turn it is to take out the trash using RFID and sends an email. Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m09P8awB5_k) of how it works.

[I2CLCD library](https://github.com/NorthOC/I2CLCD) - I2C LCD API library for Python Raspberry Pico to connect to screens.
