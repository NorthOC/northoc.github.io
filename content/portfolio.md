# IT Portfolio

I like to code, whether it's full-stack websites or software tools, and have been doing so for 2+ years. Currently, I'm also studying IT in [Utena University of Applied Sciences](https://www.utenos-kolegija.lt/en).

## Workflow

I use [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) as my main operating system and edit documents using Google [Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/), [Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) and [Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/) respectively. For editing code, I use [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## My projects

### Tools

* [damp2ph](https://github.com/NorthOC/damp2ph) (Python) - 100% of this website is generated using damp2ph. It is a static site generator, markdown parser and HTML beautifier (all in one) which I made with built-in Python libraries.

### Games (click to play)

* [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://denislisunov.xyz/rockpaperscissors/) (JavaScript) - The title says it all.

* [Mastermind](https://replit.com/@NorthOC/Mastermind-game) (Ruby) - It is a code-breaking game. Solve the puzzle yourself or let the AI do it.

* [Hangman](https://replit.com/@NorthOC/Hangman) (Ruby) - Yep, you know it. I added the extra feature of being able to save the game and return to it later.

* [Connect Four](https://replit.com/@NorthOC/connect-four) (Ruby) - The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) can explain it quicker than me.

* [Tic Tac Toe](https://replit.com/@NorthOC/Tic-Tac-Toe) (Ruby) - Classic.

### Full-stack web apps

* [Weather Dashboard app with OpenWeather API](https://github.com/NorthOC/flask-internship-course) (Flask) - Users can create their weather dashboards, show it to their friends and view annual, daily or current weather data (and download it as well).

* [Omniva terminal locator app with Omniva API](https://github.com/NorthOC/rails-task) (Ruby on Rails) - Search Omniva parcel terminals by id, location or name and download the list as an Excel file.

* [Blog app](https://github.com/NorthOC/rails-blog-app) (Ruby on Rails) - Create articles and let people comment on them.

### Misc.

* [Calculator](https://denislisunov.xyz/calculator/) (JavaScript) - One of those projects that every programmer has made. Feel free to try it out (has keyboard support).

* [IoT RFID Queue Management System with AWS](https://github.com/NorthOC/esp32-iot-trash-management-sys) (Embedded C) - I made this for school. Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m09P8awB5_k) of how it works.

* [basedflix](https://github.com/NorthOC/basedflix) (Python, Node) - For this, I reverse-engineered thepiratebay API. basedflix lets me stream almost any movie on my PC instantly (in 4k or otherwise). Apart from searching for a movie, there is list of top 100 current movies to select from.

### What about data structures and algorithms?

I've recreated many sorts (Bubble, Shell, Gnome, etc.), data structures (linked lists, binary search trees, etc.) and search  algorithms (depth-first and breadth-first) on my own (in Ruby), as well as in my classes (in C++). Some of what remains, and various other mini projects, can be found on my [github](https://github.com/NorthOC) (ex. how many moves does it take for a [chess Knight](https://github.com/NorthOC/knights-travails) to reach a certain square).

## Curriculum vitae

I have a one-page CV that I made in HTML and CSS which also includes my working experience. You can download the pdf version [from here](/static/CV_EN.pdf).

## I want to hire you! How can I get in touch?
