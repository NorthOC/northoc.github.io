# Projects

I have been coding for 3+ years and currently work as an IT specialist at [UAB "Bikuvos" Prekyba](https://bikuva.lt/) and study IT engineering in [Utena University of Applied Sciences](https://www.utenos-kolegija.lt/en).

## Front-End Web Apps (Click to play)

[Book tracker](http://denislisunov.xyz/book-library-js/) (JavaScript) - It is a front-end library web app.

[Tic Tac Toe](http://denislisunov.xyz/tic-tac-toe-js/) (JavaScript) - I bet you have played this one before.

[Calculator](https://denislisunov.xyz/calculator/) (JavaScript) - One of those projects that every programmer has made. Feel free to try it out (it has keyboard support).

[Google copycat](http://denislisunov.xyz/google-homepage/) (HTML) - It is a visual responsive recreation of Google's homepage.

[Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://denislisunov.xyz/rockpaperscissors/) (JavaScript) - The title says it all.

[DnD character creation form](https://denislisunov.xyz/dnd_charform/) (HTML) - It is a simple registration form for creating a Dungeons and Dragons character.

[Tensorflow documentation mockup](http://denislisunov.xyz/doc_mockup/) (HTML) - A documentation mockup website for Tensorflow.

## Full-stack Web Apps

[Weather Dashboard app with OpenWeather API](https://github.com/NorthOC/flask-internship-course) (Flask) - Users can create their weather dashboards, show it to their friends and view annual, daily or current weather data (and download it as well).

[Omniva terminal locator app with Omniva API](https://github.com/NorthOC/rails-task) (Ruby on Rails) - Search Omniva parcel terminals by id, location or name and download the list as an Excel file.

[Blog app](https://github.com/NorthOC/rails-blog-app) (Ruby on Rails) - It is a simple CRUD blog app.

[Decathlon leaderboards app](https://github.com/NorthOC/decathlon_leaderboards) (Flask) - It takes a csv file as input and generates the scores and leaderboards for decathlon candidates.

## CLI Apps

[damp2ph](https://github.com/NorthOC/damp2ph) (Python) - It is a static site generator, markdown parser and HTML beautifier (all in one) which I made with built-in Python libraries. 100% of this website is generated using damp2ph.

[fast-scanner](https://github.com/NorthOC/fast_scanner) (Python) - Skyscanner has removed the cheapest month options, so I reverse-engineered their API to get this feature back and add some extra functionality.

[basedflix](https://github.com/NorthOC/basedflix) (Nodejs, Python) - It is a piracy app for streaming movies in one of the many supported video players. For this to work, I had to reverse-engineer thepiratebay's API. Oh, and I also made a GUI version.

[Mastermind](https://replit.com/@NorthOC/Mastermind-game) (Ruby) - It is a code-breaking game. Solve the puzzle yourself or let the AI do it.

[Hangman](https://replit.com/@NorthOC/Hangman) (Ruby) - Yep, you know it. I added the extra feature of being able to save the game and return to it later.

[Connect Four](https://replit.com/@NorthOC/connect-four) (Ruby) - The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) can explain it quicker than me.

[Chess Knight movement](https://github.com/NorthOC/knights-travails) (Ruby) - Calculates the amount of turns it takes for a Knight chess piece to reach a certain square using recursive breadth-first search.

[Email generator with Google Civic API](https://github.com/NorthOC/event_manager_ruby) (Ruby) - It fills out email templates with data from Google Civic API.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

[Linked list](https://github.com/NorthOC/Linked-lists) (Ruby) - Ruby doesn't have a linked list data structure, so I implemented it.

[Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/NorthOC/binary-search-tree) (Ruby) - Recreation of the binary search tree data structure.

[Merge sort](https://github.com/NorthOC/merge-sort) (Ruby) - The implementation of merge sort.

## Embedded programming

[RFID Queue Management System with AWS](https://github.com/NorthOC/esp32-iot-trash-management-sys) (Embedded C, AWS) - This program was made for the ESP-32 WROOM microcontroller. It basically tracks whose turn it is to take out the trash using RFID and sends an email. Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m09P8awB5_k) of how it works.
