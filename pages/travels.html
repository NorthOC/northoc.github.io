        <p>I travel to 3-5 European countries annually, on a budget, so I know my way around the system in Europe. </p>

        <p>In my mind, there's a huge difference between travelling and taking a vacation. Here, I will share with you how to travel.</p>
        <p>The secret to cheap travelling is being available when things are on sale.
          Usually, <strong><em>discounts for both accomodation and tickets, are at their peak in late Autumn and late Spring</em></strong>.</p>
          <h2>Finding plane tickets</h2>
          <p>Always, always, always use <a href="https://www.skyscanner.net/">Skyscanner</a>.</p>
          <p>My favorite destination when using Skyscanner:</p>
          <p>From: <code>Lithuania</code>, To: <code>Everywhere</code>, Depart: <code>Cheapest month</code>, Return: <code>Cheapest month</code></p>
          <p>There's no doubt about it that this is the best website for finding plane tickets.
            You can search by airport, by country, by loose and by very specific timeframes.
            The website then scrapes all airlines for the best available results and shows them to you.
          Then you can rank those results by cheapest, fastest, etc.</p>
          <p>The downside of cheap flying is that you have to deal with, sometimes multiple stops and layovers.
          Once, when flying from Budapest to Vilnius, I had to stop in UK and Denmark for a layover (total around 24 hours), before reaching my destination.</p>
          <p>Selecting a flight with a departure and arrival date is fun.
            What's more fun is travelling via multi-city routes.
            If you have that much availability, you could travel to every european country (27) in three months for a total of about 250 euro at discount peak in Autumn.
            <strong><em>The expensive part of the trip is not the plane tickets - it's the acommodation and food.</em></strong></p>
            <h2>Where to sleep</h2>
            <p>The two obvious ones are <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> and <a href="https://www.booking.com/">Booking.com</a>. They are both similar in price, so it is more of a <em>"pick your poison"</em> situation.</p>
            <h3>Hostels</h3>
            <p>If you're just fresh out of highschool and want a different perspective on the world, this is for you. </p>
            <p>Hostels are a blast, if you're travelling solo or with a friend, and looking to mingle with other travellers and do some sightseeing together.</p>
            <p>Once, in Madrid, I met these two polish dudes, and we spent about 3 days going to various museums, restaurants and pubs.
            Another time, in Barcelona, I met two german girls who were hitchhiking to Morocco, and we went out to the beach to enjoy some wine.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, a hostel may have bikes, like in Liepaja, which you can rent for a day and travel the city that way. Other times, like in Trieste, the hostel was 7-8 km from the city center, and I had to get around by bus (thankfully, the infrastructure there is good).</p>
            <p>There's also a shared kitchen where you can cook your meals, and some of them, like the one in Barcelona and Trieste, even offer free breakfast.</p>
            <p>The only problem is that you can't leave your things just lying around. Sometimes there's a locker for your items, sometimes not, so you have to be wary of your possessions at all times. That is why, I recommend staying in hostels only when you're travelling with just a backpack on your back and no extra luggage.</p>
            <p>Hostel pros:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cheap</li>
              <li>Social</li>
              <li>Rentable bikes</li>
              <li>Good location usually</li>
              <li>Kitchen to cook</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Private Rooms / Apartments</h3>
            <p>If you like your privacy, want to have sexy time, or you want to try doing <em>"remote work & travel"</em>, then checking out a room or an apartment on Airbnb is your goto. This is the way I do it nowadays, since I travel with my girl.</p>
            <p>Usually, a fair quality to price ratio for an Airbnb is in a 2km radius from the center. In Budapest, a decently priced airbnb for me was 200m from the center, while in Prague, about 2.5km.</p>
            <p>There's definitely a kitchen, which eliminates a lot of the food costs and, rarely, there's even a free breakfast included (happened in Zakopane).</p>
            <p>Private room/apartment pros:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fairly cheap</li>
              <li>Privacy</li>
              <li>Kitchen to cook</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hotels</h3>
            <p>Unless there's a massive discount, your company booked it for you, you and your friends decided to sneak in, you're travelling to review hotels, or just visitting your sugar daddy in Dubai who already booked it, there's no reason to go to a hotel. <strong><em>Hotels are for vacations - not for travelling.</em></strong></p>
            <p>They are made specifically for one thing and one thing only - to make as much money from you as possible.</p>
            <p>In all of my travels, I only stayed in a hotel twice, in Nafplio and Innsbruck, only because it was cheaper, at the time, than any Airbnb around.</p>
            <p>
            Hotel pros:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You'll find one anywhere</li>
              <li>Privacy</li>
              <li>Perfect for a vacation</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Bus tickets</h2>
            <p><a href="https://global.flixbus.com/">Flixbus</a> for international European travel as well as travelling inside a country between cities. Flixbus was the best way to get around Denmark, Poland and Germany. It is also how I visited Venice, by taking a day trip from Trieste.</p>
            <p>However, where English is not spoken so well, for busses between a single countries cities, it is best to just go to the bus station in that city and ask there. It was unplanned but, by going to the bus station in Madrid and asking random destinations, this is how I visited Gibraltar.</p>
            <p>As for riding inner city busses, use <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/">Google Maps</a>. Pick your destination route, and then select the bus icon, which will then give you a route and time schedule for the bus. You can even view all of the stops your bus will stop at! To buy a ticket on the inner city bus, you can hop on the bus and go up to the driver and ask for a ticket.</p>
            <h2>Food</h2>
            <p>There's no golden rule other than this - plan in advance and do more cooking.</p>
            <p>Before visiting a country, I look over their national dishes and choose two to four dishes that I want to try while I'm there. </p>
            <p>Usually it is a national dish (paella, flaki, etc.), a similar fast food dish every country has (doner kebab is my guilty pleasure) and sometimes a local drink like beer, rakia, ouzo or palinka.</p>
            <p>I will then try those dishes throughout my stay, and other times I will cook food to keep everything under budget.</p>
            <h2>Hitchiking</h2>
            <p>Stand by the road, hold your thumb out and smile. When somebody stops, ask if they are in the direction you're going and if they can take you there. That's it. That is how I managed to go from Utena to Budapest in about a week.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The most important thing when hitchiking is good shoes. My shoes were tearing my feet apart after the first car that took us from Utena to Kaunas, so I had to buy these beauties in Maxima.</p>

              <figcaption>Denis with full gear on</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>For the gear, I only packed essential clothing and hygiene like soap and shaving cream.
              No snacks or food, only a single water bottle. My plan was to eat as we go and avoid the extra weight.
            For sleeping, I had a tent in hand, a sleeping bag and a green mat. The tent ended up being horrible to sleep in, due to it being too small to fit two people, plus all of our gear.</p>
