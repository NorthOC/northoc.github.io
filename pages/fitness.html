        <p>I'm not motivated, nor am I passionate about fitness - I suck it up and do it for simple reasons: to look hot and feel good.</p>

        <p>So, here's some advice on how to get fit. And a backstory to go along with that.</p>
        <h2>Breaking-point: The weight-in</h2>
        <p>They don't call it sweet 16 for nothing. </p>
        <p>It was time for the annual medical check-up that we needed for school. After the doctor told me to step on a scale, as she jotted down the numbers 7 and 0, she said to me that I now was classed "overweight" in medical terms.</p>
        <p>There had to be some sort of mistake!</p>
        <p>But guess what - it was not a mistake. I was 172cm at 70kg and honestly shocked. To be a fat kid was something I feared, and that fear sparked and urgency in me to start doing something about it.</p>
        <h2>Before: in pictures</h2>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <p>I looked like a stickman with some lower belly fat and not a single visible muscle. My workout routine was only cardio 4km a day, 5 times a week.</p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <p>Due to the wear and tear of one of my knee joints from all the running on asphalt, I quit cardio and decided to start doing calisthetics. My first PR for pull ups was 4.</p>

          <figcaption>Military gains, 2020</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Due to the 9 months in the military, I had gained some muscle. The Covid-19 pandemic was good due to being able to work out at home! I gained a lot of upper body muscle. My PR's on max pull ups were rising weekly. </p>
        <h2>After: in picture</h2>
        <p>To fully get good body proportions, I started doing ab and legs workouts.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I look in the mirror and think that I look like Tyler Durden from that <a href="/static/images/fightclub.webp">basement scene</a>. Maybe it is my imagination, but it has definitely had a deep positive impact on the way I carry myself and how others react to me, especially women.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>The best part is that I'm now keeping it up between 65-70kg, except this time it is mostly muscle. My current PR for pull ups is 55 WITHOUT KIPS (65 with kipping).</p>
        <h2>I want to get fit too! Where do I start?</h2>
        <p>Great, here's everything. As for how to do each exercise, look it up on <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube</a>.</p>
        <p>All you need is a yoga mat and a pull-up bar and you're good to go.</p>
        <p>Schedule:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Monday: Upper body.</li>
          <li>Tuesday: Upper body.</li>
          <li>Wednesday: Abs + Legs.</li>
          <li>Thursday: Upper body.</li>
          <li>Friday: Abs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><em> Do A warmup before a workout! </em></strong></p>
        <h3>Upper body</h3>
        <p>In such order: <code>Pull ups -> Triceps dips -> Push ups -> Chin ups</code></p>
        <p>Do each exercise 5 times, each time as many reps as possible and rest for 1 minute between each attempt. After the fifth time, rest for 2 minutes before moving onto the next exercise.</p>
        <p>So, in detail, do pull ups once for a max number of reps, then chill for a minute, do pull ups again, chill for a minute... do pull ups for the fifth time, chill for two minutes and move onto the next excercise.</p>
        <h3>Abs</h3>
        <p>10 different abs exercises. For each exercise, you have to either do 50 reps (ex: 50 reps of russian twists) or do a hold for a minute (ex: hold a plank for one minute). Rest when needed.</p>
        <p>For inspiration on what exercises you can do, look up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyiNCEHLyKbSUrrncVr9KvQ">Fraser Wilson</a>. If you choose to do harder exercises (ex. leg lifts), you will have faster and better results.</p>
        <h3>Legs</h3>
        <p>In such order: <code>Lunges -> Leg raises -> Quadruped single leg lift -> Standing calf raises -> Wall-sit -> Squats -> Plank</code></p>
        <p>For each exercise, you have to either do 50 reps (ex: 50 reps of lunges) or do a hold for a minute (ex: hold a wall-sit for one minute). Between each exercise, do 70 reps of jump rope skips. Rest when needed.</p>
        <h2>In the end</h2>
        <p>It is about simplicity and results.</p>
