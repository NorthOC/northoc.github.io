        <h2>Fitness</h2>
        <p>I have not been to a gym for a couple of years now, I don't run, don't take any drugs or vitamins (apart from fish oil in winter), and yet I still maintain a greek god muscular-athletic body. </p>
        <p>I'm not motivated, nor am I passionate about fitness - I suck it up and do it for simple reasons: to look hot.</p>

        <p>If there's one thing that will get you laid easily, it is a fit body with visible abs which is full of stamina and testosterone.</p>
        <p>So, here's some advice on how to get fit. And a backstory to go along with that.</p>
        <h3>Prologue: No life</h3>
        <p>In my teens I was a 360 noscope gamer (cringe). This alone should be enough for you to understand on what kind of microwaved goodies and various soysnacks I used to live on day by day. </p>
        <p>My lifestyle did not have a good affect on my body and mind. Fucked up back, flat feet, oily face and flaky hair, low self-esteem, and the ever-growing fat that, surprisingly, concentrated on my belly and ass (thankfully, no fedora or neckbeard). </p>
        <p>My thinking, at the time, was something that of a modern libtard leftist - physical exercise was for stupid people to do because they were not smart enough for mentally difficult work.</p>
        <p>As to how I ended up at that point, I know now after many years, but it is a story for another day.</p>
        <h3>Breaking-point: The weight-in</h3>
        <p>They don't call it sweet sixteen for nothing. </p>
        <p>It was time for the annual medical check-up that we needed for school. After the doctor told me to step on a scale, as she jotted down the numbers 7 and 0, she said to me that I now was classed "overweight" in medical terms.</p>
        <p>ME? OVERWEIGHT?! There has to be some sort of mistake!</p>
        <p>But guess what - it was not a mistake. I was at 70kg and honestly shocked. To be a fat kid was something I feared, and that fear sparked and urgency in me to start doing something about it.</p>
        <h3>Cardio is a scam</h3>
        <p>I called one of my gaming buddies on <a href="https://www.skype.com">Skype</a> and we decided to both start running everyday after school at the same time and then call each other (we lived in different cities) to talk about it. </p>
        <p>And this is where it ultimately started for me.</p>
        <p>My friend stopped after a month but, four years down the line, I was still busting out that 4-7km a day, five times a week, religiously. And guess what? THE RESULTS WERE SHIT!</p>
        <p>I looked like a stickman with some lower belly fat and not a single visible muscle.</p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <p>It didn't take long, until one day, while running in Denmark, I felt a slight jolt in my knee. Each running step was pain.</p>
        <p>Took a rest for a couple of days, tried running again, felt pain. Again waited a couple of days, again pain.</p>
        <h3>Ruined knee</h3>
        <p>After finishing studies abroad, I decided to go to the military to clear my head and figure out what to do next. </p>
        <p>To prepare my body for what was to come, I started doing some calisthetics 5 times a week. Honestly, it was a poor attempt due to a lack of knowledge but I did manage to gain a bit of muscle before the beginning of service.</p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <p>One day in the military, when doing intense training, I busted my knee and had to go through various doctors for three weeks. The wear and tear of years of running on asphalt has finally caught up with me.</p>
        <p>I made a decision to stop running to avoid any further damage.</p>
        <h3>Picking up the pieces</h3>
        <p>Due to the 9 months in the military, I had gained some muscle, so, to maintain that, I started doing calisthetics again (it was for the girls). </p>

        <p>I guess the cards just fell in my favor. The Covid-19 epidemic was good due to being able to work out at home! I gained a lot of upper body muscle. My PR's on max pull ups were rising weekly. </p>
        <p>To fully get good body proportions, I started doing ab and legs workouts.</p>
        <h3>Epilogue: Where are we now?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes I look in the mirror and think that I look like Tyler Durden from that <a href="/static/images/fightclub.webp">basement scene</a>. Maybe it is my imagination, but it has definitely had a deep positive impact on the way I carry myself and how others react to me, especially women.</p>
        <p>The best part is that I'm now keeping it up between 65-70kg, except this time it is mostly muscle.</p>

        <h2>I want to get fit too! Where do I start?</h2>
        <p>Great, here's everything. Now suck it up and force yourself to do it because, I swear, it never gets any easier.</p>
        <p>The further readings are from my <a href="/pages/book.html">book</a> translated to English. As for how to do each exercise, look it up on <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube</a>.</p>
        <p>All you need is a yoga mat and a pull-up bar and you're good to go.</p>
        <p>Schedule:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Monday: Upper body.</li>
          <li>Tuesday: Upper body.</li>
          <li>Wednesday: Abs + Legs.</li>
          <li>Thursday: Upper body.</li>
          <li>Friday: Abs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><em> Do A warmup before a workout! </em></strong></p>
        <h3>Upper body</h3>
        <p>In such order: <code>Pull ups -> Triceps dips -> Push ups -> Chin ups</code></p>
        <p>Do each exercise 5 times, each time as many reps as possible and rest for 1 minute between each attempt. After the fifth time, rest for 2 minutes before moving onto the next exercise.</p>
        <p>So, in detail, do pull ups once for a max number of reps, then chill for a minute, do pull ups again, chill for a minute... do pull ups for the fifth time, chill for two minutes and move onto the next excercise.</p>
        <h3>Abs</h3>
        <p>10 different abs exercises. For each exercise, you have to either do 50 reps (ex: 50 reps of russian twists) or do a hold for a minute (ex: hold a plank for one minute). Rest when needed.</p>
        <p>For inspiration on what exercises you can do, look up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyiNCEHLyKbSUrrncVr9KvQ">Fraser Wilson</a>. If you choose to do harder exercises (ex. leg lifts), you will have faster and better results.</p>
        <h3>Legs</h3>
        <p>In such order: <code>Lunges -> Leg raises -> Quadruped single leg lift -> Standing calf raises -> Wall-sit -> Squats -> Plank</code></p>
        <p>For each exercise, you have to either do 50 reps (ex: 50 reps of lunges) or do a hold for a minute (ex: hold a wall-sit for one minute). Between each exercise, do 70 reps of jump rope skips. Rest when needed.</p>
        <h2>In the end</h2>
        <p>It is all about simplicity and results. Why pay for a pricey gym membership with fancy machines, when you have your own bodyweight to work with?</p>
