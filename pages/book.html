        <h2>Yes, I wrote a book</h2>
        <p>I'm trying to self-publish it and to do that, I have to do everything myself.</p>
        <p>Currently, the book is 105 pages in its entirety, however, the revision process is increasing that page count a little bit. </p>
        <p>After revision, I will have to format the book, and for that I will be using <a href="https://www.scribus.net/">Scribus</a>. The plan here is to format the book into a printable version (the size of it will be a5) and then into an e-book.</p>
        <h2>Current problems</h2>
        <p>I need to design the cover. No ideas there, but we'll see.</p>
        <p>But before that, I still have to decide on a title. As of now, the book still has no final title.</p>
