        <p>I have been working out for almost a decade now, and it has had a tremendous effect on my mind and body.</p>
        <p>So, here's some advice on how to get fit. And a backstory to go along with that.</p>
        <h2 id="in_a_10_year_span">In a 10 year span</h2>
        <p>I was 14 years old and in the overweight category (70kg and 172cm). </p>
        <p>With no idea on how to get to where I want to be, I started running. My workout routine was only cardio - 4km a day, 5 times a week.</p>
        <p>After about 6 years of that, the results were subpar. Lost some fat, but had no muscle. If you looked at me, you couldn't tell that I "work out". </p>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Six years of running will get you this, 2018</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So I quit cardio and decided to start doing calisthetics. My first PR for pull ups was 4.</p>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>What are those!, 2019</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I would say that this was the starting point of actual progress. Constant PRs, body morphing into better shape. I was loosing bits of fat and gaining muscle mass. Also, pull ups fixed my scoliosis.</p>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Getting there slowly, 2020</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The Covid-19 pandemic was good due to being able to work out at home. To fully get good body proportions, I started doing ab and legs workouts and have been doing the same thing for 3 years. Oh, and also I started intermittent fasting (16/8 cycle).</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/static/images/fitness/fit4.png" alt="Woah, is that me?, 2021"/>
          <figcaption>Woah, is that me?, 2021</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>At some point I hit my max PR which I believe is my hard cap. My current PR for pull ups is 55 WITHOUT KIPS (65 with kipping). To achieve more, without going to the gym and lifting weights, I would have to start training with weighted vests and watching what I eat to a T.. or start taking PEDs (performance enhancing drugs).</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/static/images/fitness/fit5.jpg" alt="Apex performance, 2022"/>
          <figcaption>Apex performance, 2022</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The best part is that I'm now keeping it up at 70kg at 176 cm, except this time it is mostly muscle.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/static/images/fitness/fit6.png" alt="This is me now, 2023"/>

        <h2 id="i_want_to_get_fit_too_where_do_i_start">I want to get fit too! Where do I start?</h2>
        <p>All you need is a yoga mat, a jump rope and a pull-up bar and you're good to go.</p>
        <p>Schedule:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Monday: Upper body.</li>
          <li>Tuesday: Upper body.</li>
          <li>Wednesday: Abs + Legs.</li>
          <li>Thursday: Upper body.</li>
          <li>Friday: Abs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="the_workout">The workout</h2>
        <p><strong><em> Do A warmup before a workout to avoid injury! </em></strong></p>
        <h3 id="upper_body">Upper body</h3>
        <p>In such order: <code>Pull ups -> Triceps dips -> Push ups -> Chin ups</code></p>
        <p>Do each exercise 5 times, each time as many reps as possible and rest for 1 minute between each attempt. After the fifth time, rest for 2 minutes before moving onto the next exercise.</p>
        <p>So, in detail, do pull ups once for a max number of reps, then chill for a minute, do pull ups again, chill for a minute... do pull ups for the fifth time, chill for two minutes and move onto the next excercise.</p>
        <h3 id="abs">Abs</h3>
        <p>10 different abs exercises. For each exercise, you have to either do 50 reps (ex: 50 reps of russian twists) or do a hold for a minute (ex: hold a plank for one minute). Rest when needed.</p>
        <p>For inspiration on what exercises you can do, look up <a target='_blank' href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyiNCEHLyKbSUrrncVr9KvQ">Fraser Wilson</a>. If you choose to do harder exercises (ex. leg lifts), you will have faster and better results.</p>
        <p>Of couse, if you're fat, no amount of ab training will bring those muscles out.</p>
        <h3 id="legs">Legs</h3>
        <p>In such order: <code>Lunges -> Leg raises -> Quadruped single leg lift -> Standing calf raises -> Wall-sit -> Squats -> Plank</code></p>
        <p>For each exercise, you have to either do 50 reps (ex: 50 reps of lunges) or do a hold for a minute (ex: hold a wall-sit for one minute). Between each exercise, do 70 reps of jump rope skips. Rest when needed.</p>
        <p>It is also good to invest in a bicycle (but this is optional), and ride around your city, instead of using a car.</p>
