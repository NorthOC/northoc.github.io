        <p>I have been working out for almost a decade now, and it has had a tremendous effect on my mind and body.</p>
        <p>So, here's some advice on how to get fit. And a backstory to go along with that.</p>
        <h2 id="they_don_t_call_it_sweet_16_for_nothing">They don't call it sweet 16 for nothing. </h2>
        <p>It was time for the annual medical check-up that we needed for school. After the doctor told me to step on a scale, she jotted down the numbers 7 and 0, and said to me that I now was classed "overweight" in medical terms.</p>
        <p>I was 172cm at 70kg and honestly shocked. To be a fat kid was something I feared, and that fear sparked and urgency in me to start doing something about it.</p>
        <h2 id="in_a_7_year_span">In a 7 year span</h2>
        <p>With no idea on how to get to where I want to be, I started running. My workout routine was only cardio - 4km a day, 5 times a week.</p>
        <p>After about 4 years of that, the results were subpar. Lost some fat, but had no muscle. If you looked at me, you couldn't tell that I work out. So I quit cardio and decided to start doing calisthetics. My first PR for pull ups was 4.</p>
        <p>I would say that this was the starting point of actual progress. Constant PRs, body morphing into solid, shape. I was gaining mass. And then I went to the military.</p>
        <p>Due to the 9 months in the military, I had gained even more muscle. After that, it was back to doing what I know best, pull-ups.</p>
        <p>The Covid-19 pandemic was good due to being able to work out at home! My PR's on max pull ups were rising weekly. </p>
        <p>To fully get good body proportions, I started doing ab and legs workouts and have been doing the same thing for 2 years.</p>
        <p>The best part is that I'm now keeping it up between 65-70kg, except this time it is mostly muscle. My current PR for pull ups is 55 WITHOUT KIPS (65 with kipping).</p>
        <h2 id="i_want_to_get_fit_too_where_do_i_start">I want to get fit too! Where do I start?</h2>
        <p>All you need is a yoga mat and a pull-up bar and you're good to go.</p>
        <p>Schedule:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Monday: Upper body.</li>
          <li>Tuesday: Upper body.</li>
          <li>Wednesday: Abs + Legs.</li>
          <li>Thursday: Upper body.</li>
          <li>Friday: Abs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><em> Do A warmup before a workout! </em></strong></p>
        <h3 id="upper_body">Upper body</h3>
        <p>In such order: <code>Pull ups -> Triceps dips -> Push ups -> Chin ups</code></p>
        <p>Do each exercise 5 times, each time as many reps as possible and rest for 1 minute between each attempt. After the fifth time, rest for 2 minutes before moving onto the next exercise.</p>
        <p>So, in detail, do pull ups once for a max number of reps, then chill for a minute, do pull ups again, chill for a minute... do pull ups for the fifth time, chill for two minutes and move onto the next excercise.</p>
        <h3 id="abs">Abs</h3>
        <p>10 different abs exercises. For each exercise, you have to either do 50 reps (ex: 50 reps of russian twists) or do a hold for a minute (ex: hold a plank for one minute). Rest when needed.</p>
        <p>For inspiration on what exercises you can do, look up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyiNCEHLyKbSUrrncVr9KvQ">Fraser Wilson</a>. If you choose to do harder exercises (ex. leg lifts), you will have faster and better results.</p>
        <h3 id="legs">Legs</h3>
        <p>In such order: <code>Lunges -> Leg raises -> Quadruped single leg lift -> Standing calf raises -> Wall-sit -> Squats -> Plank</code></p>
        <p>For each exercise, you have to either do 50 reps (ex: 50 reps of lunges) or do a hold for a minute (ex: hold a wall-sit for one minute). Between each exercise, do 70 reps of jump rope skips. Rest when needed.
