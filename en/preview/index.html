        <p>This is a preview that should help you decide if this book is for you.</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The information you will find in me will open your eyes, show the world through a unique lens, but I cannot tell you whether this is good or bad.</p>
<p>Reading me will make you angry. First your anger will be directed towards me, then at the world, then at your parents, then at yourself. When you come to terms with it, a learning process of several years will begin, starting with suffering and ending with peace.</p>
<p>I can assure you - you will know the answers to everything that is generally important for men. The words "I don't know" will become a curse word. You will ask less “why” and “how”. Love will become predictable, life will become seamless, and women will become simple.</p>
<p>If you choose not to read me, it may be that between ages 45 and 65 you will discover the game all on your own and realize that you could have lived your life differently. If this happens, you will either fall into depression and despair, or you will accept the time you’ve lost and start living differently. We call this the midlife crisis.</p>
<p>Both lives have their pros and cons, so, before it's too late, I leave it to you to choose whether to read on or put me back on the shelf. Unfortunately, the author of this book did not have this choice.</p>
<p>To make the whole process easier and faster, I will ask for only one thing: read me with an open mind. Even when it feels like it's completely against what you already know, finish reading the chapter and try to disprove it in your environment. Observe people, observe their speech, observe their actions, compare to what you learned and draw conclusions.</p>
<p>For those who accidentally stumbled upon this book - I apologize in advance for the discomfort, anger and hatred you will experience.</p>
<p>And for those who are here with a goal - good luck.</p>
<h2>2. Theory</h2>
<p>I will have to destroy the dream you are living in. If you want to imagine, it will be similar to the YouTube video "Tupac's transformation".</p>
<p>After that, I will introduce you to the “love game", in which the whole world is participating. </p>
<p>I'm going to show you what are the popular strategies for men and why they are ineffective for sleeping with many women or creating a happy relationship. I will also provide you with an alternative.</p>
<p>You will learn what women want, why infidelity occurs and the differences between a woman and a man.</p>
<p>At the end of this chapter, I'll reveal to you how men are exploited by women, how governments protect women from men, and why "good" men don't get laid.</p>
<p>For men, these are important topics and in our early teens we start wasting a lot of time, trying to figure these things out. But soon we learn that such topics are taboo in mainstream society. Men are afraid to ask their friends for advice - we don't want to appear weak, and usually our friends don't know what to advise. "Be yourself" they parrot.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Theory section is to deconstruct your current world view of love and women and form a realistic view of the world step by step.</p>
<p>There are 5 steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Denial</li>
  <li>Anger</li>
  <li>Bargaining</li>
  <li>Depression</li>
  <li>Acceptance</li>
</ol>
<p>Denial will begin after reading the first subsections. This is your defense mechanism, trying to protect the beliefs you formed before. What you read will seem sexist, cynical, etc.</p>
<p>The second, anger stage, is short (up to several months), but intense. You will get angry: first at me, then at women, then at the world.</p>
<p>The negotiation stage is your last attachment to your dream. You will accept the vast majority of reality, but there will still be some ideas that you will try to justify.</p>
<p>The depression stage usually lasts the longest when you realize that the world you knew was lying to you. This stage marks a lack of understanding of the nuances of the world. Only by letting go of your emotions towards the past will you be able to move on to the next level.</p>
<p>Recognition is the last step. You will accept that the world is the way it is, and no amount of rethinking or emotion will change that.    </p>
