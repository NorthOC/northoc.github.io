        <p>Alright, so at some point, you decide to put on some big boy pants and start making pull requests and commiting to open-source projects to make the world a better place. But I guess this is where the first of many god complexes come to die for many young developers.</p>
        <h2 id="projects_are_part_of_the_problem">Projects are part of the problem</h2>
        <p>Each open-source project (that matters) has its own pull request standard which can usually be found in some <code>commits.md</code> file or a specific directory, that can be from a couple of pages to dozens of pages in length.</p>
        <p>The upsides of this is that you limit spaghetti code and the number of noob devs on the contributor list because such projects assume that you already know how to do all that fancy git magic..</p>
        <p>The downsides of this is that you get a small number of contributors, who add actual features. I'm not talking about the dev who do 100s of commits just to reformat the README. No, I'm talking about devs who actually expand on the project further and fix bugs. This is a common bottleneck that bigger projects face and the outcome of this is obvious: when other other projects come to light, these amalgamations will go as they arrived - swiftly. Why? Because time is precious.</p>
        <h3 id="a_common_example">A Common Example</h3>
        <p>For example take the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">React</a> repo. I'm sure that some of you front-endies are gonna be reeeeing at this, but take a moment to digest this simple fact:</p>
        <p>The React repo has over 1500 contributors, and top 6 devs make up for about 50% of all commits. These top contributors are not your standard open-source contributors. They work at Facebook, so it is kind of their job to do this.</p>

          <figcaption>Familiar feeling?</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The rest of the commits are divided between ~1494 people, which mostly did typo fixes. But before they could submit a fix that took them 2 minutes, they had to go through <a href="https://code.fb.com/codeofconduct">The Code of Conduct</a> and then <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html">The Contributing Guide</a>, spending about 30 minutes of their life, just so that they could feel good.</p>
        <h2 id="what_s_the_solution">What's the solution?</h2>
        <p>To fork the project, change the contribution standards and claim it your own.</p>
        <p>Just kidding. The solution is to be mindful of these practices, notice them early and avoiding projects that employ complex commit schemes like the plague.</p>
        <h2 id="the_simple_way_to_commit">The simple way to commit</h2>
        <p>Heres a simple way to do this stuff (the green lines are cli commands):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Fork the repository you want to contribute to</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Clone the fork to your pc with <code>git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository name</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Create a branch for your feature with <code>git checkout -b branch_name</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add the branch upstream so that github has access to it <code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Edit the code</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><code>git add .</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><code>git commit -m "message of what you've changed"</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><code>git push</code></p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once this is done, open your fork in the browser. There should be two buttons above the files saying <strong>"Contribute"</strong> and <strong>"Sync Fork"</strong>. Click the contribute button and then <strong>"Open pull request"</strong>. Write what you've changed, submit it and let the project jannies do the rest of the work.</p>

        <p>That's the gist of it, but git is way more complex than this. So take your time to learn a bit more about resolving conflicts and how the HEAD works.</p>

        <p>Congrats! You now have the ability to make the world a slightly better place.</p>
