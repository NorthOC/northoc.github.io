        <p><em>It's been half a year since I wrote my last post. Here's the update for the second half of 2024:</em></p>
        <p><em>Finished studies and got my degree in IT and it went as expected. Travelled from Bulgaria to Japan in the span of 3 months, visiting Turkey, UAE, India and Thailand along the way. You can watch that trip on <a target='_blank' href="https://www.youtube.com/@denislisunov/videos">my YouTube channel</a>. Lost some muscle while travelling, but have managed to build it all back, and then some. And still working on my goal towards 5 000 000. Yes, the project in the previous posts is still being built. Problem is that I have burned out, and the progress is slow. I boot up my PC, but the last thing I want is to open up a code editor, and smash out some code. But I know that this phase will end (because this has happened before) and I will achieve what I have set out to achieve. Things take time. You take time. And everything falls into place, if you keep your goal in mind. Anyways, back to today's post.</em></p>
        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
        <p>This is no fairy tale. </p>
        <p>There are no elves or orcs. </p>
        <p>But there are three dragons. </p>
        <p>With big teeth and horns.</p>
        <p>These dragons are mortal - in that they can die. </p>
        <p>But this is no easy task, and there are no guarantees. </p>
        <p>The good news is that you have unlimited tries. </p>
        <p>The bad news is that you have limited time. </p>
        <p>Each dragon requires a different approach. </p>
        <p>And each strategy takes 5 years or more. </p>
        <p>Whether the rewards are worth it, </p>
        <p>Depend only on you. </p>
        <p>But beating them all, </p>
        <p>Will give you something, which no other can do.</p>
        <h2 id="the_green_dragon_reward_health">The green dragon (Reward: Health)</h2>
        <p>If you choose to ignore, avoid or give in.</p>
        <p>The dragon will steal your health from within.</p>
        <p>So sleep every night.</p>
        <p>At the same hour.</p>
        <p>Eat greens and meat.</p>
        <p>No sugar or flour.</p>
        <p>Its weakness is your axe - the workout you do.</p>
        <p>Its place of peril is the gym you go to.</p>
        <p>Attacking this dragon, 4-5 days a week.</p>
        <p>Will give more strength and time that you seek.</p>
        <h2 id="the_blue_dragon_reward_happiness">The blue dragon (Reward: Happiness)</h2>
        <p>This dragon is a trickster. His way is to lie.</p>
        <p>If you come alone, then you'll certainly die.</p>
        <p>So visit a tavern or volunteer at events.</p>
        <p>Shoot many arrows - with strangers and friends.</p>
        <p>Be present with people, and don't be afraid.</p>
        <p>By sharing your likes and your nays, </p>
        <p>You will find someone.</p>
        <p>Who believes and who trusts. </p>
        <p>A sister, a brother, a friend.</p>
        <p>Or a partner.</p>
        <p>Who will want to join.</p>
        <p>And bring your life joy.</p>
        <h2 id="the_red_dragon_reward_freedom">The red dragon (Reward: Freedom)</h2>
        <p>The red dragon has 4 different games.</p>
        <p>And you get to choose, the one's you'll play.</p>
        <p>So pick one,</p>
        <p>Career, business, rentals or stocks.</p>
        <p>Master it well, to grow your loot and your flock.</p>
        <p>Avoid status games, for they are a trap.</p>
        <p>And also grifters, who sell quick ways out.</p>
        <p>Be patient, persistent, </p>
        <p>Because bad times will come.</p>
        <p>And after they pass, </p>
        <p>You'll go further and far.</p>
        <p>The dragon will die, </p>
        <p>And you will stand tall.</p>
        <h2 id="ending">Ending</h2>
        <p>By slaying the dragons, you'll get what you want.</p>
        <p>You will have the freedom, the time and the love.</p>
        <p>But that is not all that is gained from this quest.</p>
        <p>The experience, the perspective, </p>
        <p>A new piece of mind.</p>
        <p>Will guide your decisions for the rest of your life.</p>
