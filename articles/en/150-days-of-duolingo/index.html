        <h2 id="context">Context</h2>
        <p>I have set myself one goal - to learn the 6 most used languages, to such a level that I can understand and communicate with locals. I already know English, that's 5 left. When I googled, the first choice was clear - Spanish. I have been to Spain several times. I plan to visit Latin America sometime.</p>

        <h2 id="por_donde_empezar_where_to_start">¿Por dónde empezar? / Where to start?</h2>
        <p>At first I used pirated <a target='_blank' href="https://www.michelthomas.com/learn-spanish/">Michel Thomas</a> tapes, but over time I didn't develop a habit of learning from them (too passive). So, I decided to try Duolingo (further aka. bird).</p>
        <p>It was a cautious choice because I had previous experience with the bird and it was much different before. In the past you were just bombarded with ads and notifications until you either left or bought a subscription. Of course, I didn't buy it. </p>
        <p>It has been a few years, so I decided to try again and after 150 days of learning, I can say that my opinion has changed a bit.</p>
        <h2 id="tiempo_de_aprender_learning_time">Tiempo de aprender / Learning time</h2>
        <p>The first 100 days, I did several lessons a day until I ran out of hearts. After that, my studies decreased to 1-2 lessons a day. Now I spend an average of up to 8 minutes every day on this thing.</p>

        <p>In the beginning, while learning the language, I got a lot of new information, so it was interesting. However, over time I digested and learned that information through constant repetition.</p>
        <p>At Unit 20, that repetition became more of a hindrance because of the lack of new information.</p>
        <h2 id="realizaciones_realizations">Realizaciones / Realizations</h2>
        <p>I realized that Spanish is very similar to English in places.</p>
        <p>Some things were strange in the beginning: e.g. In Spanish, if you are hungry, you should say "I have hunger" (tengo hambre) or if you are cold - "I have a cold" (tengo frio).</p>
        <p>Other than that, Spanish doesn't seem that difficult.</p>
        <h2 id="puedo_ver_series_de_television_can_i_watch_series">¿Puedo ver series de televisión? / Can I watch series?</h2>
        <p>Tried watching <a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Heist">La Casa de Papel</a> (by the way, it literally translates to Money House, not Money Heist). I can understand the context in places and tell a lot about what is being talked about, but small details still slip by my ears. Sometimes the characters seem to talk too fast.</p>
        <p>I can read the news hardly, because, in many articles, sophisticated and unusual words are used, so I have to use a translator.</p>
        <p>But songs are different because they are slower. I finally understand what <a target='_blank' href="https://youtu.be/DUT5rEU6pqM?t=125">Shakira</a> sings (she definitely can make a man wanna speak Spanish) and all the other trending Espanglish musicians.</p>
        <h2 id="conclusion_conclusion">Conclusión / Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Bird is a good way to start learning a language, but a bad way to learn it well. You have to deepen your knowledge in other ways.</p>
        <p>Apart from the bird, I also tried to learn by reading a <a target='_blank' href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/168813">book</a>, but it didn't stick.</p>
