        <h2 id="context">Context</h2>
        <p>The only goal I have not achieved in my life is financial freedom. So I guess, the best time to start is now. </p>
        <p>I always prefered living on fringe frugality, and I would be glad to quit my job and continue doing so. But now, I have a long-term partner and, as I approach 26 years old, it is time to start thinking about family. </p>
        <p>Do I want my family to live frugally? Hell no. I want them to travel, get a good education and grow up in a warm climate, full of fruit trees. While I spend most of my time with them (not working).</p>
        <p>Lets begin.</p>
        <h2 id="the_goal">The goal</h2>
        <p>Here's a promise: In less than 9 years, I will be retired, chillin with my gf and kids on a farm, travelling at least 1/3rd of the year. This is my reality.</p>
        <p>I am going to build a solution to a problem that ultimately creates 5 million euros of value before I reach the age of 35. </p>
        <p>Why 5 million? Because at a very conservative annual return rate of 4%, the index fund would yield me 200k/yr (before taxes). That is more than enough, not only to survive, but to continue building future wealth for the generations to come, after I grow old and die.</p>
        <h2 id="how_am_i_gonna_do_it">How am I gonna do it</h2>
        <p>In a vast sea of books, I don't think my chances of becoming the next <a target='_blank' href="https://mangetlaid.com">J.K. Rowling</a> are great. </p>
        <p>But, because I put my time to good use, I am going to build a business with code.</p>
        <p>My plan:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Find a problem.</li>
          <li>Create a solution.</li>
          <li>Market the solution. </li>
          <li>Get feedback. </li>
          <li>Improve solution.</li>
          <li>Go back to step 3.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="filtered">
          <p>We are making proper solutions to existing problems with long-term goals in mind. There is no audience to sell to, no brand, no investors or VCs, and none of that "indie hacker SaaS launch in 3 weeks" shit. </p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="what_if_you_fail">What if you fail?</h2>
        <p>Here's the good thing: <strong><em>I have unlimited tries. And I only need to succeed once.</em></strong> Read that again. If I make 10 businesses, fail 9 times and succeed once - that's it. I win. Is that true failure? No. Those previous times would be considered as learning experience.</p>
        <p>True failure is giving up.</p>
        <h2 id="what_s_next">What's next?</h2>
        <p>The first step: finding a problem. Stay tuned.</p>
